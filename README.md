# Uber Application (MERN Stack)  

## üöÄ Overview  
This is a 'Basic' full-stack Uber-like application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application provides two main interfaces: one for **Users** and another for **Captains** (drivers). Users can request rides by selecting pickup and destination locations, choosing a vehicle type, and confirming the ride. Captains receive ride requests, confirm or decline them, and manage the ride until completion.
